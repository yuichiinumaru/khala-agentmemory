# 12-ROADMAP.md: Roadmap & Vision

**Project**: KHALA v2.0
**Reference**: [01-plan-overview.md](01-plan-overview.md)

---

## 1. Version History

*   **v1.0 (Legacy)**: Basic vector storage, no graph.
*   **v2.0 (Current)**: Full "Khala" implementation. Agno + SurrealDB + 100 Strategies. Modules 1-10 complete.

---

## 2. Immediate Roadmap (Phase 2 & 3)

### Phase 2: Optimization & Novelty (Q4 2025)
*   [ ] **SurrealDB Tuning**: Nested docs, computed fields, advanced vector configuration.
*   [ ] **Experimental Patterns**: Flows vs Crews, Dream-Consolidation.

### Phase 3: Advanced Intelligence (Research Integration) (Q1 2026)
*   [ ] **PromptWizard**: Automated prompt optimization service.
*   [ ] **ARM**: Homogeneous reasoning modules.
*   [ ] **LGKGR**: Knowledge Graph Reasoning with GNNs.
*   [ ] **LatentMAS**: High-bandwidth latent state collaboration.
*   [ ] **MarsRL**: Multi-agent reinforcement learning loop.

---

## 3. Future Plans (v3.0)

### v3.0: Federation & Edge
*   [ ] **Khala Swarm**: Multiple Khala instances syncing knowledge.
*   [ ] **Edge Khala**: Lightweight version for local devices.
*   [ ] **Rust Core**: Porting critical paths (embeddings, graph traversal) to Rust.

## 4. Long-Term Vision

To build the **Universal Memory Standard** for AI agents—a protocol where any agent, regardless of its LLM or framework, can plug into a Khala instance and instantly gain long-term, structured, and evolving memory, powered by the latest research in neuro-symbolic reasoning and multi-agent collaboration.
