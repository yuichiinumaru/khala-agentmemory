# 01-PLAN.md: KHALA v2.1 Project Plan

**Project**: KHALA (Knowledge Hierarchical Adaptive Long-term Agent)
**Version**: 2.1 (Resurrection)
**Framework**: Agno + SurrealDB
**Date**: December 2025
**Status**: STRUCTURAL RESURRECTION

---

## 1. Executive Summary

### Project Vision
Resurrect and harden the KHALA memory system into a production-grade, secure, and reliable foundation. The Autopsy (Dec 2025) revealed critical structural and security failures. We are now in the "Resurrection Era".

### Core Objective
Systematic elimination of fragility followed by Cognitive Evolution (Titans/MIRAS integration).

### Key Deliverables
1.  **Governance Enforcement**: `AGENTS.md` is the law. `docs/` is the truth.
2.  **Security Hardening**: Eliminate RCE and DoS vectors.
3.  **Data Integrity**: Ensure timestamps and versions are immutable and correct.
4.  **Cognitive Depth**: Implement Surprise Metrics and Deep Memory (Phase 4).

## 2. Project Scope

### Phase 3.1: Structural Resurrection (Completed)
-   [x] Governance Audit & File Cleanup.
-   [x] Documentation Alignment (`01`, `02`, `03`).
-   [x] Task Purification.

### Phase 3.2: Surgical Intervention (Active)
-   [x] **Critical Security Fixes**: CLI Executor, API Auth.
-   [x] **Data Integrity Fixes**: SurrealDB Client.
-   [x] **Reliability Fixes**: Gemini Client, Lifecycle Service.

### Phase 4: Cognitive Evolution (Titans/MIRAS)
*Implementation of Google Research "Titans" concepts on SurrealDB.*
-   **Surprise Metric**: Tracking novelty to guide retention.
-   **Momentum**: Context boosting around anomalies.
-   **Deep Memory**: Explicit derivation hierarchy (`Raw` -> `Episode` -> `Pattern`).
-   **Adaptive Retention**: Formulaic forgetting gates.

### Phase 5: Advanced Features (Deferred)
-   Module 15 (Version Control).
-   Optimization Strategies.

## 3. Implementation Strategy

1.  **Stop the Bleeding**: No new features until Critical tasks in `02-tasks.md` are closed.
2.  **Verify Every Stitch**: Use TDD where possible. Verify fixes with `read_file` or reproduction scripts.
3.  **Fail Fast**: Crash on error. Do not swallow exceptions.
4.  **Zero Trust**: Trust no input, trust no path.

## 4. Progress Tracking
See `docs/02-tasks.md` for the active execution queue.
