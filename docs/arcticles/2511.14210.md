# Orion: A Unified Visual Agent for Multimodal Perception, Advanced Visual Reasoning and Execution
**Link**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14210v2

## Summary
We introduce Orion, a visual agent that integrates vision-based reasoning with tool-augmented execution to achieve powerful, precise, multi-step visual intelligence across images, video, and documents. Unlike traditional vision-language models that generate descriptive outputs, Orion orchestrates a suite of specialized computer vision tools, including object detection, keypoint localization, panoptic segmentation, Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and geometric analysis, to execute complex multi-step visual workflows. The system achieves competitive performance across MMMU, MMBench, DocVQA, and MMLongBench while extending monolithic VLM capabilities to production-grade visual intelligence. Through its agentic, tool-augmented approach, Orion enables autonomous visual reasoning that bridges neural perception with symbolic execution, marking the transition from passive visual understanding to active, tool-driven visual intelligence.

## Offering to Project
## Analysis for Khala
**Status:** Highly Relevant
**Keywords:** agent, multimodal, vlm, reasoning

This paper presents concepts directly applicable to Khala's core architecture (Memory, Reasoning, Security). We should investigate integrating its findings into the Domain or Infrastructure layers.
