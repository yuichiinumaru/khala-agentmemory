# Khala User Guide: The Shared Consciousness

> *"From order, comes justice. From memory, comes strength."*

Welcome to **Khala**, the biological memory kernel for VIVI OS agents. 

Unlike traditional RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems that act like simple filing cabinets, Khala is designed as a **Living Nervous System**. It doesn't just store data; it dreams, evolves, and connects agents through a shared graph of understanding.

## 📚 How to Read This Guide

## 🔮 The Vision
Khala aims to solve the "Amnesia Problem" in AI. By providing a persistent, evolving, and shared memory graph, we enable agents to:
- **Recall** past interactions across sessions.
- **Deduce** new information from existing facts.
- **Collaborate** without needing to talk, simply by reading the shared mind.
